## About My Thoughts in "Transfer the text to Vector"

In modern, there are lots of differents models to deal with the serveral problems (Before the ChatGPT). For example : 

* Summary Task
* Recommendation System (Content-based)
* Classfication task
* Translation Task
* Generative AI

Most of the above tasks is built by deep learning model. Once we need an input for the model or computation, we should let the text data transferred into vector.
